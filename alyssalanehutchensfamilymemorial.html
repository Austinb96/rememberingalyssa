    <p> “I’ve been sitting in classrooms every year observing all of my teachers, cataloging their teaching styles, lesson plans, and even how they interacted with their students into categories of what I do or do not want to do when it is my turn to lead a classroom.  One of my favorite things that I’ve seen from various educators is how their relationships with their students don’t just end at the classroom door.  My teachers have pushed me to my limits and shown me that I have space beyond the barriers I set for myself.  It would be an honor and privilege to be half the teacher that all of mine were for me.”</p>
