    <p>“I would like to continue to do patient care at this time but slowly move into a leadership position.  I am very interested in quality improvement and hope to advance my career in this area while focusing on patient care and safety.  I have recently lead a CQPI group, done training sessions in quality improvement, and furthered by education outside of school for quality improvement/assurance.  I hope to use this education to focus on improvement efforts for our patients and our department.” </p>
